//If a function with an opaque return type returns from multiple places, all of the possible return values must have the same type.

//Differences Between Opaque Types and Protocol Types
//Returning an opaque type looks very similar to using a protocol type as the return type of a function, but these two kinds of return type differ in whether they preserve type identity. An opaque type refers to one specific type, although the caller of the function isn’t able to see which type; a protocol type can refer to any type that conforms to the protocol. Generally speaking, protocol types give you more flexibility about the underlying types of the values they store, and opaque types let you make stronger guarantees about those underlying types.
